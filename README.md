# Oversquashing in GNNs through the lens of information contraction and graph expansion

Code for the synthetic experiments in our paper on oversquashing in GNNs (preprint: [arXiv:2208.03471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03471)). To test the spectral expansion of a graph under RLEF, GRLEF, or SDRF, run the file plots.py. By default, it will produce a figure for a path of 3 cliques, each with 10 vertices.

## Requirements
The repository uses the following packages:

```
numpy
networkx
matplotlib
pandas
```
