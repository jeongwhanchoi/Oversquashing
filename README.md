# Oversquashing in GNNs through the lens of information contraction and graph expansion

Code for the synthetic experiments in our paper on oversquashing in GNNs. To test the spectral expansion of a graph under RLEF, GRLEF, or SDRF, run the file synthetic.py. By default, it will produce a figure for a path of 3 cliques, each with 10 vertices.
